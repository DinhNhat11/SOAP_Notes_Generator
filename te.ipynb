      "Patient: Not really. Work has been a little hectic, but nothing unusual. And Iâ€™m not on any new medications.\n",
      "\n",
      "Doctor: Understood. Iâ€™d like to run a few basic testsâ€”check your blood sugar, thyroid levels, and iron levelsâ€”to rule out any underlying issues like anemia or thyroid problems. Sound good?\n",

      "Doctor: Itâ€™s good that you came in. Fatigue can have many causes, and weâ€™ll figure out whatâ€™s going on. In the meantime, try to keep a consistent sleep schedule, cut down on caffeine in the evenings, and stay hydrated.\n",

      "Patient: Alright, that sounds reasonable.\n",
